# Splurty


This is an app that allows for quotes to be entered by visitors. The quotes get saved to a database, and then appear at random on the homepage for others to read. It was built using a Ruby on Rails framework, with a PostgreSQL database. Bootstrap was applied to add definition to the styling that came with HTML5 and CSS3.
